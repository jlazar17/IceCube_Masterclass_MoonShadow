You can call this with a date given in a few different formats. First, you can give a datetime `str` in the form `\"YYYY-MM-DD[-HH-MM-SS]\"`. Also you can provide this as a Modified Julian Date (MJD). While this may sound scary, it is just a way of representing a date as a number, with each day being one integer increment.
